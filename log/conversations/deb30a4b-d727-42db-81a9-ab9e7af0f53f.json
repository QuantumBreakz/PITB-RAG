The initial context provided includes information about a dairy farm with specific details on infrastructure such as sheds, washrooms, and stores.\n2. The user asked for the updated total infrastructure cost when certain changes are made to the shed space, store capacity, and worker rooms.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe changes requested are:\n\n* Shed for Wet Cows: Increased from 8,000 sq.ft to 14,000 sq.ft (a 75% increase)\n* Stores: Increased from 400 sq.ft to 900 sq.ft\n* Rooms (Workers): Increased from 300 to 800\n\nCalculations:\nTo determine the new total infrastructure cost, we need to recalculate the costs for each component:\n\n1. Shed for Wet Cows:\n\t* Original Cost: Rs. 8,000,000 (at Rs. 1,000/sq.ft)\n\t* New Cost: Rs. 14,000,000 (at Rs. 1,000/sq.ft) (75% increase)\n2. Stores:\n\t* Original Cost: Rs. 280,000 (at Rs. 700/sq.ft)\n\t* New Cost: Rs. 630,000 (at Rs. 900/sq.ft) (125% increase)\n\nAssumptions:\nNo changes are made to the unit cost of other infrastructure components.\n\nUpdated Total Infrastructure Cost:\n1. Shed for Wet Cows: Rs. 14,000,000\n2. Open Paddock for Wet Cows: Rs. 160,000\n3. Shed for Dry Cows: Rs. 4,000,000\n4. Open Paddock for Dry Cows: Rs. 160,000\n5. Shed for Calves: Rs. 2,000,000\n6. Open Paddock for Calves: Rs. 80,000\n7. Stores (fodder, concentrate & machines): Rs. 630,000\n8. Rooms (Workers): Estimated additional cost due to increased rooms from 300 to 800 (Rs. 17,230,938 - 64,578 = Rs. 16,165,360)\n\nNew Total Infrastructure Cost: Rs. 17,233,358",
