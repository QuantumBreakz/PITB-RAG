I'm glad you're here.\n\n**Context and Conversation History**\n\nFor our context, we have information about a QA chatbot that utilizes a vector database like FAISS for direct database extraction. The key points from the conversation history are:\n\n* Extracting text from PDFs/Word files using PyPDF2 or python-docx\n* Chunking text into smaller segments with LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n* Generating embeddings using a lightweight model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 22 MB)\n* Storing embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS)\n\n**Your Question**\n\nYou simply asked to confirm your name, which is indeed \"Naveed\".\n\nSince the provided context and conversation history don't contain sufficient information to answer your question directly, I'll simply acknowledge that you've introduced yourself.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss any further questions or concerns about the chatbot's architecture or implementation, I'm here to help!",

For queries, embed the user input and retrieve top-k chunks using co-\nsine similarity.\n\u2022 Advantages:\n\u2013 Simplifies architecture by avoiding a separate knowledge base.\n\u2013 Reduces setup time, critical for a 7-day deadline.\n\u2013 Secure for government data, as all processing is in-house. \u2013 Requires upfront preprocessing effort.\n\u2013 Increases storage if raw documents are also stored.\n\u2013 Needs updates when documents change.\n2.4\nRecommendation\nFor the QA chatbot, direct database extraction using a vector database like\nFAISS is recommended.
