      "content": "Real-time databases are designed to handle high-performance, low-latency transactions that require immediate response times. They typically offer the following characteristics:\n\n* **High availability**: Real-time databases ensure that data remains consistent across all nodes in the system.\n* **Low latency**: Transactions are processed quickly, often in milliseconds or microseconds.\n* **Scalability**: Real-time databases can handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally to meet increasing demands.\n\nSome examples of real-time databases include:\n\n* **Cassandra**: A distributed NoSQL database designed for handling high-performance, low-latency transactions.\n* **RocksDB**: An open-source, embeddable NoSQL database optimized for performance and scalability.\n* **LevelDB**: A lightweight, embedded NoSQL database that provides a simple and efficient storage solution.\n\nFor the context of storing document text or embeddings for semantic retrieval, real-time databases may not be the best choice. Instead, consider using:\n\n* **Vector databases** (e.g., FAISS): Ideal for RAG, enabling fast similarity searches.\n* **Full-text search databases** (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite): Suitable for traditional database queries but less effective for semantic queries.\n\nIn your case, storing embeddings in a vector database like FAISS would be an efficient and scalable solution.",
